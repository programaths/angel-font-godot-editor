# angel-font-godot-editor

For now, it only permits to use the UI.

Still need to generate the "fnt" file itself.
Also add the line height property, xadvance, xoffset and yoffset

Another useful feature would be to read back fnt files

If you test, you will notice that everything is scaled x2. Values too.
I was just too lazy to halve values ^^
